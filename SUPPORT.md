## Help us help you

Invest time in formulating your questions and include relevant links and resources. This initial effort can save time for everyone in the long run.

Here are some tips:

- [Talk to a duck](https://rubberduckdebugging.com)!
- Donâ€™t fall for the [XY problem](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/66377/what-is-the-xy-problem/66378#66378)
- Conduct a search to check if a similar question has already been asked.
- Clearly define your needs:
  - Is there a specific task you're trying to accomplish?
  - What issue are you encountering, and what steps have you taken to resolve it?
  - Is there a concept you're struggling to grasp?
- Provide sample code, such as a [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io) or video, if possible
- While screenshots can be helpful, please also provide the relevant text, such as code snippets or error messages.
- The more effort you invest in framing your question, the more effectively we can assist you.
