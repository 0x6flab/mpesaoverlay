<Info>
  **Prerequisite**

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Docker (version 24.0.5 or higher).

- Docker compose (version 2.20.3 or higher).

- golang (version 1.21 or higher).

- Make (version 4.4.1 or higher).

- Node.js (version 18.10.0 orhigher).

</Info>

## Code

### Compiling

To compile the different services run the following command:

```bash
make all
```

This will compile the different services and place them in the `build` folder.

To build a specific service for example the cli run the following command:

```bash
make cli
```

To install the different services run the following command:

```bash
make install
```

### Docker

Step 1. To build the docker images run the following command:

```bash
make dockers_dev
```

If you want to build the docker images for production run the following command:

```bash
make dockers
```

Step 2. To run the different services run the following command:

```bash
make run
```

This will run the different services using docker compose in the background.

Step 3. To watch the logs of the different services run the following command:

```bash
make logs
```

Step 4. To stop the different services run the following command:

```bash
make stop
```

This will stop the different services using docker compose.

### Env Variables

Mpesaoverlay uses port `9000` by default for the grpc adapter and `1883` for the mqtt adapter. You can set up the different ports in the `docker/.env` to customize the ports. For example:

```bash
### GRPC Adapter
MO_GRPC_HOST=localhost
MO_GRPC_PORT=9001
MO_GRPC_URL=${MO_GRPC_HOST}:${MO_GRPC_PORT}

### MQTT Adapter
MO_MQTT_HOST=localhost
MO_MQTT_PORT=9002
MO_MQTT_URL=${MO_MQTT_HOST}:${MO_MQTT_PORT}
```

You will see an error if you try to run mpesaoverlay in a port that's already taken

### Proto Files

Make sure that you have [Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/) (version 21.12) compiler `protoc` installed.

[Go Protobuf](https://github.com/golang/protobuf) installation instructions are [here](https://github.com/golang/protobuf#installation).
Go Protobuf uses C bindings, so you will need to install [C++ protobuf](https://github.com/google/protobuf) as a prerequisite.
Protocol Buffers for Go with Gadgets installation instructions can be found [here]("google.golang.org/protobuf/proto").

If you change SDK `requests.go` and `responses.go` run the following command to generate the new proto files:

```bash
make proto
```

This will sync the proto files with the gRPC server and gRPC client.

### Testing

To run the tests run the following command:

```bash
make test
```

This will also generate a mock interface for the SDK which will be used in the tests.

To run linting run the following command:

```bash
make lint
```

This will run the linting for the different services.

## Documentation

Step 1. Install Mintlify on your OS:

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm i -g mintlify
```

```bash yarn
yarn global add mintlify
```

</CodeGroup>

Step 2. Go to the docs are located (where you can find `mint.json`) and run the following command:

```bash
cd docs
```

```bash
mintlify dev
```

The documentation website is now available at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Custom Ports

Mintlify uses port 3000 by default. You can use the `--port` flag to customize the port Mintlify runs on. For example, use this command to run in port 3333:

```bash
mintlify dev --port 3333
```

You will see an error like this if you try to run Mintlify in a port that's already taken:

```md
Error: listen EADDRINUSE: address already in use :::3000
```

### Mintlify Versions

Each CLI is linked to a specific version of Mintlify. Please update the CLI if your local website looks different than production.

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm i -g mintlify@latest
```

```bash yarn
yarn global upgrade mintlify
```

</CodeGroup>

## Continuous Integration

Github Actions is used for continuous integration. The workflow is located in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.

The following steps are run in the workflow:

1. Build all services across different platforms.
2. Build docker images for all services.
3. Run tests for all services.
4. Run linting for all services.

## Continuous Delivery

Github Actions is used for continuous delivery. The workflow is located in `.github/workflows/cd.yml`.

Building the docker images and pushing them to github container registry is done in the workflow.
