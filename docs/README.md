# MpesaOverlay Documentation

This is the documentation for the MpesaOverlay project. It is built using [Mintlify](https://mintlify.com) and hosted on [mpesaoverlay.rodneyosodo.com](https://mpesaoverlay.rodneyosodo.com).

## 👩‍💻 Development

Install the [Mintlify CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mintlify) to preview the documentation changes locally. To install, use the following command

```bash
npm i -g mintlify
```

Run the following command at the root of your documentation (where mint.json is)

```bash
mintlify dev
```

## 😎 Publishing Changes

Once your pull request has been merged, the changes will be automatically published to [mpesaoverlay.rodneyosodo.com](https://mpesaoverlay.rodneyosodo.com).

### Troubleshooting

- Mintlify dev isn't running - Run `mintlify install` it'll re-install dependencies.
- Page loads as a 404 - Make sure you are running in a folder with `mint.json`
